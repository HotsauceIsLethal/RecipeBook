Help me to create a smart contract in solidity called IceBot. It is a market making bot that buys ICEBRK erc20 tokens from spooky.fi

Sure, I can help you create a smart contract in Solidity called IceBot. Here's an example code to get you started:
*/
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./IERC20.sol"; // Import the ERC20 interface

contract IceBot {
    address private constant ICEBRK_ADDRESS = 0x...; // Replace with the address of the ICEBRK token
    address private constant SPOOKY_FI_ADDRESS = 0x...; // Replace with the address of the Spooky.fi exchange
    
    uint256 private constant BUY_PRICE = 1 ether; // Replace with the desired buy price in wei
    
    receive() external payable {
        // Accept ETH sent to this contract
    }
    
    function buyICEBRK() external {
        IERC20 icebrk = IERC20(ICEBRK_ADDRESS);
        require(icebrk.balanceOf(address(this)) == 0, "IceBot: already holding ICEBRK"); // Ensure the bot is not already holding ICEBRK
        
        uint256 ethBalance = address(this).balance;
        require(ethBalance > 0, "IceBot: no ETH to buy ICEBRK"); // Ensure the bot has enough ETH to buy ICEBRK
        
        uint256 icebrkBalance = icebrk.balanceOf(SPOOKY_FI_ADDRESS);
        require(icebrkBalance > 0, "IceBot: no ICEBRK available for purchase"); // Ensure there are ICEBRK tokens available for purchase
        
        uint256 ethNeeded = icebrkBalance * BUY_PRICE / 1 ether; // Calculate the ETH needed to purchase the available ICEBRK tokens
        require(ethBalance >= ethNeeded, "IceBot: insufficient ETH to purchase ICEBRK"); // Ensure the bot has enough ETH to purchase the available ICEBRK tokens
        
        (bool success, ) = SPOOKY_FI_ADDRESS.call{value: ethNeeded}(""); // Send the ETH to the exchange to purchase ICEBRK tokens
        require(success, "IceBot: failed to purchase ICEBRK");
        
        icebrk.transfer(address(this), icebrkBalance); // Transfer the purchased ICEBRK tokens to the bot's address
    }
}
*/This code defines a IceBot contract with a buyICEBRK function that buys ICEBRK tokens from the Spooky.fi exchange using ETH held by the contract. The contract also defines a constant BUY_PRICE that represents the desired buy price of ICEBRK tokens in wei.

To use this code, you need to replace the placeholder addresses for the ICEBRK token and the Spooky.fi exchange with their actual addresses. You also need to set the BUY_PRICE constant to your desired buy price.

/*Note that this code is just an example and should be thoroughly tested and audited before deploying to a production environment.
